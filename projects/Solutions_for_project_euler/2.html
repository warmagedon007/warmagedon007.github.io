    <h1>Problem 1:</h1>
    <p>
        Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

        By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
        lets start small, lets sum all the multiples of 2 or 3 under 10, so we have, 2, 4, 6, 8 as multiples of 10. and 3, 6, 9
        as multiples of 3. as you can see, we count 6 twice. On a larger scale of the problem. we need to remove duplicates.
        so lets count the steps: <br />
        <ol>
            <li>Iterate and sum the multiples of 3</li>
            <li>Iterate on the multiples of 5, check if they are devided by 3, if they are, dont sum them.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

            console.log(3 * i);
        }
        i = 0;
        while (5 * i < 1000) {
            i++;
            if (i % 3 === 0) continue;
            else sum += 5 * i;
            console.log(5 * i);
        }
        document.getElementById("solution").textContent = "the sum is: " + sum;
